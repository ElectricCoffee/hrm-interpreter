# Human Resource Machine Interpreter

This is a simple program that lets me run the Human Resource Machine scripts locally.

## What is Human Resource Machine?

Human Resource Machine is a game by _Tomorrow Corporation_, the studio that also made _Little Inferno_ and _7 Billion Humans_.

The game is about making office workers run around and perform menial tasks to a set of pseudo-assembly instructions.

## Goal

The goal of this application is to simply facilitate a program that can run and execute the instructions used in-game.
Essentially letting you write and run the program without having to wait for the office worker to do their job.

### Limitations

Currently it only supports writing out the script inside main with a number of instructions.

## Roadmap

- [x] Create basic interpreter
- [ ] Add File support
- [ ] Add support for letters
